# Overview of this project

The Clock N Block is a machine that is stacks blocks in different configurations. A user will input blocks 
in the feeders where the little arrows point, and the robot will take care of the rest.
This is mostly a project that people will look at and watch it do its thing.


The documentation will be split up into a few sections:    

[Setup](setup.md):   
A guide on how to setup, train, and get the machine started by configuring all the constants.   

[Software](software/software.md):  
A overview of the code and how each piece works and interacts with the rest of the systems.  
  
Hardware:  
This section will be split up into the mechanical and electrical sections.  
We had a lot of issues with the mechanical side of the project, so this section will be a bit more in depth.  
  
Future Work:  
A list of things that could be done to improve the machine.
