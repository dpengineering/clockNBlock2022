# Overview of this project

The Clock N Block is a machine that is stacks blocks in different configurations. A user will input blocks 
in the feeders where the little arrows point, and the robot will take care of the rest.
This is mostly a project that people will look at and watch it do its thing.


The documentation will be split up into a few sections:    

[Usage](usage.md):  
How to run and use the machine. Also, how the files are structured on the RPi in the project

[Setup](setup.md):   
A guide on how to setup, train, and get the machine started by configuring all the constants.   

[Software](software.md):  
A overview of the code and how each piece works and interacts with the rest of the systems.  
However, the code itself is the best place to look for how this works. Just follow the "threads" from the main file out.

[Hardware](hardware/hardware.md):  
This section will be split up into the mechanical and electrical sections.  
We had a lot of issues with the mechanical side of the project, so this section will be a bit more in depth.  
  
Future Work:  
A list of things that could be done to improve the machine.
